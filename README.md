# Spotify Shuffle

`spot-shuffle` is a small tool I use personally to combine and preshuffle playlists, removing duplicates.

I prefer the preshuffle since I've had inconsistent experiences with default shuffle when playing from phone, phone with spotify connect, queueing etc. 

Since for my use case I always prefer shuffled, a pre-shuffle can't hurt.

## Usage

In .env, specify:

```
AUTH_HEADER=
USER_ID=
PLAYLIST_1=
PLAYLIST_2=
```

## Future Work

Probably optional preshuffle, ordering, more than two playlist etc.
